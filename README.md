# CodeWars
This repo is a collection of codewar challenges I have completed. Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as Kata. These discrete programming exercises train a variety of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online Integrated development environment.
